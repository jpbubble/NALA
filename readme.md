NALA = NIL and Lua Adventures.
NALA is an engine based on the BUBBLE engine specifically specialized for the use in RPG and Adventure games, and basically the successor of LAURA II. The name change is most of all due to the fact that NALA will have built-in NIL 
support where LAURA II never had that (although it should technically be possible to add NIL into LAURA II, since NIL has been written in Lua after all).

# WIP

When you read this notice, this project is still in WIP status, it will grow over time, and its first use will most likely be for the planned revamp of "The Secrets of Dyrt".
No ETAs have been set, nor will they ever be, so don't ask me about them, okay?
